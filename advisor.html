					Reza Ehsani specializes in advanced harvesting technologies. He brings to his job experience from several states and countries 
					as well as honors including a scholarship from the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science and Blue Ribbon Awards for his 
					educational projects from the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers. He came to the UF Citrus Research and Education 
					Center in 2005 to focus on the needs and interests of Florida's extensive citrus industry.
					</p>
					<p>
					At the grocery store or roadside fruit stand, we see citrus fruit neatly stacked in pyramids or piled in bushel baskets. The abundance 
					of citrus is a sight that many people identify with Florida, and these iconic images have gone around the world on millions of 
					postcards. Citrus came to Florida with the Spanish in its earliest days, but was first developed as a commercial crop in the 
					nineteenth century. Since that time, Florida citrus has acquired a worldwide reputation and become a major player in the state's economy.
					</p>
					<p>
					However, in the last 50 years, Florida citrus has faced a series of challenges that have changed the economics of producing this 
					crop in significant ways. Interstate and international competitors, new pests and diseases, production costs and conditions, 
					some serious freezes, and even hurricanes have all taken their toll on Florida's citrus industry.
					</p>
					<p>
					Nevertheless, we could paraphrase Mark Twain's words: any report of the demise of Florida's citrus industry is an exaggeration. 
					As the author of a recent UF report on the future of citrus observed, the citrus industry is very resilient. Florida produces roughly 
					two-thirds of the annual U.S. crop of 10 million or so tons, dominating orange and grapefruit production. Over 90% of Florida's 
					citrus becomes juice. Demand for citrus -- especially oranges -- continues to grow both in the U.S and overseas. So even though 
					the citrus industry may contract somewhat in the near future, the value of citrus continues to rise.
					</p>
					<p>
					This brings us back to the real challenges that citrus producers face. Maintaining and developing Florida's citrus industry are 
					the main tasks of the Citrus Research and Education Center. With the many years of combined experience of its researchers, educators, 
					and trainers, and its unparalleled outreach and rapport with producers, the CREC is vital to Florida citrus and the economic life 
					and image of the state.
					</p>
					<p>
					And this is where researchers/educators like Reza Ehsani come in. He is looking for ways to make the citrus industry more profitable 
					by developing and introducing harvesting techniques based on the latest technologies. His work is fascinating and ingenious and touches 
					on areas of mechanics, electronics, satellite and aerial imagery, and robotics -- all aimed at giving Florida's citrus producers an 
					additional edge.
					</p>
					<p>Ehsani's prime target is improving the bottom line for producers by lowering the cost of harvesting, but his research has important 
					implications for other aspects of citrus production. Ehsani says that a major problem for the citrus industry is the shortage of 
					laborers for harvesting. Oranges must fully ripen on the tree, and when they are ready, they must be harvested in a timely and efficient 
					manner; otherwise fruit will become overripe or spoil. The majority of Florida's oranges are harvested by hand, but this process is 
					time-consuming and labor-intensive. According to Ehsani, recent changes to immigration laws and competition from other labor-intensive 
					industries, such as construction, have resulted in a significant labor shortage in the groves.
					</p>
					<p>
					A small percentage of Florida oranges are mechanically harvested, and this method is much more efficient than hand harvesting and 
					generates significant labor savings. Ehsani explains that basically mechanical harvesters shake the tree canopy and catch the fruit 
					as it falls. The first mechanical harvesters stopped at each tree and shook it by its trunk, but this form of harvesting is no longer 
					used for citrus. More recent harvesters use long metal rods to gently shake the canopy of the tree itself and do not stop at all, 
					moving steadily down one row of trees after another. While mechanical harvesters have advantages over hand harvesting, there is room 
					for improvement. For one thing, in addition to the fruit, mechanical harvesting tends to pull down a lot of leaves and twigs. This 
					trash must be separated from the oranges for several reasons, but finding a mechanical means of doing this is tricky. Ehsani has been 
					collaborating with another ABE researcher, Daniel Lee, to develop and test conveyor systems that can remove trash while the oranges 
					are being transferred from the harvester to the fruit hauling trailer.
					</p>
					<p>
					Another project that Ehsani is working on involves an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, or UAV. Large UAVs are used by the military, but small 
					UAVs have now been developed that are affordable for even small producers to take aerial images of their groves. The new generation UAV 
					that Ehsani is experimenting with offers many new opportunities -- it is inexpensive, battery powered, fully automated, and GPS guided. 
					The device can be programmed for a 20-minute flight that can take it up and over a grove and return real-time aerial images. These 
					images can be further processed to determine exactly which trees need nutrition or are affected by disease. This saves producers a lot 
					of time by alerting them to problems or needs without having to walk an entire grove, and it gives them a viewpoint they would not 
					normally have. In addition, because it is simple and inexpensive, these UAVs can be flown as often as needed. The same service using 
					an airplane would be prohibitively expensive for most producers, which limits such flights to about once a season.
					</p>
					<p>
					In another application that integrates several of Ehsani's specialties, he described an autosteering tractor that uses GPS navigation 
					and an onboard computer to drive straight up and down the rows of a field with great precision. At the same time, the tractor can 
					pull devices that till, plant, or perform other needed operations. Ehsani had worked with these devices in vegetable crops and in 
					strawberry fields, but he had not seen them used in citrus and immediately saw the potential. He proposed this technology for planting 
					new groves and cut the cost of doing so in half.
					</p>
					<p>Ehsani brings a twenty-first century approach to the traditions of the agricultural engineering profession. He uses the latest 
					technology to solve producer problems and to make their operations more efficient, more profitable, and more productive.
